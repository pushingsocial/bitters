### Closet Revolutionary

The interview question surprise me.

"Tell me something that I don't know about you"

I'm a closet revolutionary.

It sounded exhilirating to say it. I didn't quite know what it meant. But it felt right.  I was hired.  The interviewer told me a few months later that she hired me because she believed my answer.

I've been trying to live up to that title ever since.

### Why?

I've been haunted by a statistic.  It says that most businesses fail in their first year.  The majority of the freshmen survivors perish their sophomore year.  

That sucks and from my experience the statistic is true.  

This node is about creating simple tools to help people beat the odds and live through their first year, flourish in their second and dominate in their third.

### Your Role

At some point I will offer you something.  You'll like it. It will be exactly what you need.  But in the meantime, you can watch me think out loud here.
